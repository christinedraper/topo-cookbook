#
# To refresh attributes from the topology on each chef run, include this
# recipe - or any topo recipe - in the runlist and set the attribute:
# node.override['topo']['refresh_attributes'] = true
#
# This does NOT set the runlist or chef environment (as
# this would require rerunning the chef-client from within the chef-client).
#
# The actual logic to refresh the attributes occurs in the attribute file,
# so that attributes are loaded at the expected time.
#
# The recipe cannot set the refresh_attributes attribute itself, as it
# would be too late in the execution flow. The purpose of this recipe is
# to ensure the node is configured the way you want.

unless node['topo']['refresh_attributes']
  fail("Set node['topo']['refresh_attributes'] to true")
