topo Cookbook
=============

This cookbook supports unattended bootstrap of nodes when 
using the [knife-topo plugin](https://github.com/christinedraper/knife-topo) 
to configure single or multi-node topologies.
This can be useful in combination with CloudFormation or other 
provisioning tools.

#Usage

Upload a topology definition to the Chef Server using knife-topo:
```
knife topo import test1.json
knife topo create test1
```

Use a single attribute in a first-boot json file of each node to specify 
the topology name, and optionally a node type:

```
firstboot.json
{
  "topo": {
    "name": "test1",
    "node_type": "appserver"
  }
}
```

Trigger the unattended bootstrap by running: 

```
chef-client -o topo::setup_node --json firstboot.json
chef-client
```

The first chef-client run will set the configuration (runlist, chef
environment, tags and attributes) based on the uploaded topology
and either the node name or the node type; the second run will apply 
that configuration.

#Attributes

* node['topo']['name'] - Name of the topology to be used to configure 
the node
* node['topo']['node_type'] - If node.name is not found in the 
topology, then this attribute will be used to find a match.
* node['topo']['blueprint_name'] - If no topology data bag item matching
node['topo']['name'] is found, then this attribute is used as an 
alternative.
